# NBA Injury Scraper

This repository provides a simple backend for `<insert front-end project here>`. It also serves as a proof-of-concept for using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to update a [JSON database](https://p1ho.github.io/nba-injuries/nba-injuries.json) stored on GitHub to emulate a self updating backend.

Because Travis CI is set to build daily, the JSON database will always stay up-to-date.
